# Open-IMX Initiative
IMX is a specialized data format created to describe the Dutch railway system with a strong emphasis on geographical details, rather than relying on traditional schematic diagrams to represent the network.

Open-IMX is an **open-source** software organisation dedicated to enhancing the accessibility and usability of IMX data. Our mission is to provide a suite of tools that empower developers, data analysts, and railway professionals to work effectively with IMX files. 

**Community-Driven Development**: We believe in the power of **open-source** and collaboration. Open-IMX encourages contributions from developers and users alike, fostering a community where ideas are shared, and innovations are born.

**Educational Resources**: We provide documentation, tutorials, and support to help users understand IMX data and how to utilize our tools effectively. Our resources aim to bridge the gap between technical expertise and practical application.

Whether you are a developer looking to contribute to open-source projects, a data analyst seeking to leverage IMX data, or a railway professional aiming to enhance your workflows, Open-IMX invites you to join our community. 

***Together, we can shape the future of railway data management, making it more accessible and efficient for everyone.***

# Product Vision: imxInsights

### Vision Statement
**imxInsights** is an innovative, open-source python libary designed to transform IMX data into valuable, actionable insights. It empowers railway professionals to make informed decisions and drive digital transformation within the railway sector, serving as a foundation for data-driven practices in daily operations.

*Due to safety considerations, the scope is limited to information extraction, ensuring that any modifications to the data remain the responsibility of authorized infrastructure design partners. This approach safeguards critical safety data effectively.*

### Background and Purpose
The Dutch railway sector is shifting from traditional schematics to a more detailed, (geospatial)data representation of the railway system through the IMSpoor domain model. IMX is a xml format of IMSpoor, and meticulously describes the railway infrastructure, defining object types, attributes, and their relationships. While beneficial for data exchange, its complexity often makes it less accessible to those who need to interpret and apply this data operationally.

**imxInsights** aims to make IMX data not only accessible but also continuously relevant for data-driven work. Additionally, the initiative emphasizes establishing a foundation, enabling the next generation of digital engineers to leverage and extend these tools, fostering long-term innovation within the railway industry.


#### Why Python
In summary, we believe that Python will help us create a powerful and user-friendly platform that effectively addresses the challenges of data adoption.

Python is known by its ease of use, clean syntax and allows efficient code writing and quick onboarding of new users and contributors and has strong community backing that provides valuable resources, documentation and extensive library support. The rich ecosystem, especially for data analysis provides powerful tools for delivering valuable insights, aligning perfectly with our focus on data-driven decision-making and enabling us to deliver valuable insights to our users.


## Goals and Objectives

### 1. Simplify Access to IMX Data

**imxInsights** aims to make IMX data easier to interpret by converting it into human-readable formats such as population reports, comparison tables, and geographical visualizations. This empowers users to extract and visualize the relevant data, enhancing efficiency and decision-making. **imxInsights** facilitate the data quality improvement process by making it possible to identifying inconsistencies and providing insights. Additonal it supports the data review process during the issuance and intake of projects.


### 2. Foster an Open-Source Community for Innovation

This fosters a culture of shared knowledge and innovation, continually pushing the boundaries of what imxInsights can achieve. And makes it possible to build innovative solutions to daily challenges, supporting the growing demand for digitally skilled engineers in the sector.

By engaging industry experts and newcomers, the project nurtures an environment where knowledge is shared, skills are developed, and contributors from various backgrounds collaborate 

Building a robust community is essential to our success, our approach includes:

- **Mentorship Program:** We support new contributors by providing guidance and resources to help them thrive within the community.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Collaboration is key. We foster an open-source environment where experiences and expertise are shared freely.
- **Nurturing Digital Engineers:** We aim to cultivate the next generation of talent by offering educational resources and mentorship.


### 3. Ensure Continuous Development 

**imxInsights** is built to evolve, each version introduces incremental improvements while maintaining backward compatibility to ensure smooth transitions between updates.
A structured strategy ensures that the platform adapts to changing user needs, technology advancements.

#### Strategic Direction for imxInsights

A long-term roadmap is guided by the evolving needs of the industry. Community input is key, ensuring that future versions of imxInsights are aligned with emerging technologies and railway industry challenges. The **visioning** process encourages ongoing innovation, identifying opportunities for the platform to address the railway sector needs.

- **Identifying Future Challenges:** We anticipate emerging challenges in the railway industry and adapt our platform accordingly.
- **Engaging Stakeholders:** We actively seek input from industry stakeholders to ensure alignment with emerging technologies and user needs.
- **Establishing a Clear Roadmap:** Our roadmap addresses the evolving demands of railway professionals while promoting innovation and progress.

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization and Reporting**: imxInsights presents complex IMX data in formats that are easy to understand and act upon, including population overviews, geographical standards, and difference analysis. 

   *We use industry standard like pandas for tabluar views and geojson for map data, this way we make sure we have interopibility whit other appliactions in the IT ecosystem*

### Future Features:

- **Validation and Analitics**: Ensuring a safe rail design requires data to be complete and accurate. In the near future, the data exchange scope and data fill guidelines will be integrated into the reports. 

   *Additionally, there are plans to develop a validation rule engine to enable automated data checks, ensuring consistency and reliability.*

- **Network Insights**: By introducing these network analytics capabilities, **imxInsights** will empowering our users with analytics of routes. Primarly this feature will be used for **Geometric Generation** of objects like train detection sections for a clear visual representation. 

   *This feature can be used as a fundation for advanced analitics like Route Optimization or failer impact analyses.*


## Target Audience
