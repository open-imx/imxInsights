# Product Vision: imxInsights

### Vision Statement
**imxInsights** is an innovative, open-source python libary designed to transform IMX data into valuable, actionable insights. It empowers railway professionals to make informed decisions and drive digital transformation within the railway sector, serving as a foundation for data-driven practices in daily operations.

*Due to safety considerations, the scope is limited to information extraction, ensuring that any modifications to the data remain the responsibility of authorized infrastructure design partners. This approach safeguards critical safety data effectively.*

### Background and Purpose
The Dutch railway sector is shifting from traditional schematics to a more detailed, (geospatial)data representation of the railway system through the IMSpoor domain model. IMX is a xml format of IMSpoor, and meticulously describes the railway infrastructure, defining object types, attributes, and their relationships. While beneficial for data exchange, its complexity often makes it less accessible to those who need to interpret and apply this data operationally.

**imxInsights** aims to make IMX data not only accessible but also continuously relevant for data-driven work. Additionally, the initiative emphasizes establishing a foundation, enabling the next generation of digital engineers to leverage and extend these tools, fostering long-term innovation within the railway industry.


### Why Python
In summary, we believe that Python will help us create a powerful and user-friendly platform that effectively addresses the challenges of data adoption.

Python is known by its ease of use, clean syntax and allows efficient code writing and quick onboarding of new users and contributors and has strong community backing that provides valuable resources, documentation and extensive library support. The rich ecosystem, especially for data analysis provides powerful tools for delivering valuable insights, aligning perfectly with our focus on data-driven decision-making and enabling us to deliver valuable insights to our users.

## Current Features

- **Data Visualization and Reporting**: **imxInsights** presents complex IMX data in formats that are easy to understand and act upon, including population overviews, geographical standards, and difference analysis. 

    *We use industry standard like pandas for tabluar views and geojson for spatial data, this way we make sure we have interopibility whit other appliactions in the ecosystem.*


## Target Audience

**imxInsights** is designed for all kinds of Railway Professionals, this includes engineers, designers, and other project members who require accessible, actionable insights from IMX data to make informed decisions and improve operational efficiency.

Companies within the railway sector can benefit from **imxInsights** by leveraging an open-source platform that fosters collaboration, transparency, and flexibility. Open-source tools can be customize to fit their specific needs, reduce vendor locks and contribute to a growing community focused on improving industry standards. 

In addition to industry professionals, academic institutions and researchers can benefit from **imxInsights** by using railway data for in-depth analysis, simulations, and studies aimed at advancing transportation research.

Overall, **imxInsights** is designed to support anyone invested in the railway ecosystem, enabling better decision-making, fostering collaboration, and advancing the future of rail transport.

## Real-World Use Cases
- **Review Process Support**: Achieving a safe rail design requires implementing traceable changes within the dataset. A critical aspect of this process is a structured change review, involving multiple stakeholders. **imxInsights** generates standardized difference reports facilitating this review process. 

    *In the near future updates will further enhance workflow support within **imxInsights** to streamline collaboration and oversight.*

## Future Features

- **Network Insights**: By introducing these network analytics capabilities, **imxInsights** will empowering our users with analytics of routes. Primarly this feature will be used for **Geometric Generation** of objects like train detection sections for a clear visual representation.
 
    - The next step we will be building an API to retrieve route information. This will support queries to analyze routes and compare them against various "ways" or alternatives. *This feature can be used as a fundation for advanced analitics like Route Optimization or failer impact analyses.*

- **Validation and Analitics**: Ensuring a safe rail design requires data to be complete and accurate. In the near future, the data exchange scope and data fill guidelines will be integrated into the reports. 

    *Additionally, there are plans to develop a validation rule engine to enable automated data checks, ensuring consistency and reliability.*
