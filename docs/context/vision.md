# Product Vision: imxInsights

### Vision Statement
**imxInsights** is an innovative, open-source python libary designed to transform IMX data into valuable, actionable insights. It empowers railway professionals to make informed decisions and drive digital transformation within the railway sector, serving as a foundation for data-driven practices in daily operations.

*Due to safety considerations, the scope is limited to information extraction, ensuring that any modifications to the data remain the responsibility of authorized infrastructure design partners. This approach safeguards critical safety data effectively.*

### Background and Purpose
The Dutch railway sector is shifting from traditional schematics to a more detailed, (geospatial)data representation of the railway system through the IMSpoor domain model. IMX is a xml format of IMSpoor, and meticulously describes the railway infrastructure, defining object types, attributes, and their relationships. While beneficial for data exchange, its complexity often makes it less accessible to those who need to interpret and apply this data operationally.

**imxInsights** aims to make IMX data not only accessible but also continuously relevant for data-driven work. Additionally, the initiative emphasizes establishing a foundation, enabling the next generation of digital engineers to leverage and extend these tools, fostering long-term innovation within the railway industry.


#### Why Python
In summary, we believe that Python will help us create a powerful and user-friendly platform that effectively addresses the challenges of data adoption.

Python is known by its ease of use, clean syntax and allows efficient code writing and quick onboarding of new users and contributors and has strong community backing that provides valuable resources, documentation and extensive library support. The rich ecosystem, especially for data analysis provides powerful tools for delivering valuable insights, aligning perfectly with our focus on data-driven decision-making and enabling us to deliver valuable insights to our users.


##### Rust
While Python excels in ease of use and flexibility, we recognize the importance of performance in certain aspects. 
That's why we want to use Rust for performance-critical components. Rust is known for its speed and concurrency support. 
By "Rustifying" performance-heavy operations, we can ensure that our platform remains responsive and efficient without sacrificing the user-friendly nature of Python.


## Goals and Objectives

### 1. Simplify Access to IMX Data

**imxInsights** aims to make IMX data easier to interpret by converting it into human-readable formats such as population reports, comparison tables, and geographical visualizations. This empowers users to extract and visualize the relevant data, enhancing efficiency and decision-making. **imxInsights** facilitate the data quality improvement process by making it possible to identifying inconsistencies and providing insights. Additonal it supports the data review process during the issuance and intake of projects.


### 2. Foster an Open-Source Community for Innovation

This fosters a culture of shared knowledge and innovation, continually pushing the boundaries of what imxInsights can achieve. And makes it possible to build innovative solutions to daily challenges, supporting the growing demand for digitally skilled engineers in the sector.

By engaging industry experts and newcomers, the project nurtures an environment where knowledge is shared, skills are developed, and contributors from various backgrounds collaborate 

Building a robust community is essential to our success, our approach includes:

- **Mentorship Program:** We support new contributors by providing guidance and resources to help them thrive within the community.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Collaboration is key. We foster an open-source environment where experiences and expertise are shared freely.
- **Nurturing Digital Engineers:** We aim to cultivate the next generation of talent by offering educational resources and mentorship.


### 3. Ensure Continuous Development 

**imxInsights** is built to evolve, each version introduces incremental improvements while maintaining backward compatibility to ensure smooth transitions between updates.
A structured strategy ensures that the platform adapts to changing user needs, technology advancements.

## Strategic Direction for imxInsights

A long-term roadmap is guided by the evolving needs of the industry. Community input is key, ensuring that future versions of imxInsights are aligned with emerging technologies and railway industry challenges. The **visioning** process encourages ongoing innovation, identifying opportunities for the platform to address the railway sector needs.

- **Identifying Future Challenges:** We anticipate emerging challenges in the railway industry and adapt our platform accordingly.
- **Engaging Stakeholders:** We actively seek input from industry stakeholders to ensure alignment with emerging technologies and user needs.
- **Establishing a Clear Roadmap:** Our roadmap addresses the evolving demands of railway professionals while promoting innovation and progress.


The Technical Steering Committee meetings take place on a monthly basis. 
They are usually on the second Wednesday of the month in the evening Europe-time.
These monthly meetings are open to everybody and you are welcome to join us there and say hi. 
The meeting MS team link gets published in our Discord channel roughly 1 week before the meeting.


## Current Features

- **Data Visualization and Reporting**: imxInsights presents complex IMX data in formats that are easy to understand and act upon, including population overviews, geographical standards, and difference analysis. 

   *We use industry standard like pandas for tabluar views and geojson for spatial data, this way we make sure we have interopibility whit other appliactions in the ecosystem*

## Future Features:

- **Validation and Analitics**: Ensuring a safe rail design requires data to be complete and accurate. In the near future, the data exchange scope and data fill guidelines will be integrated into the reports. 

   *Additionally, there are plans to develop a validation rule engine to enable automated data checks, ensuring consistency and reliability.*

- **Network Insights**: By introducing these network analytics capabilities, **imxInsights** will empowering our users with analytics of routes. Primarly this feature will be used for **Geometric Generation** of objects like train detection sections for a clear visual representation. 

   *This feature can be used as a fundation for advanced analitics like Route Optimization or failer impact analyses.*


## Target Audience

**imxInsights** is designed for all kinds of Railway Professionals, this includes engineers, designers, and other project members who require accessible, actionable insights from IMX data to make informed decisions and improve operational efficiency.

Companies within the railway sector can benefit from imxInsights by leveraging an open-source platform that fosters collaboration, transparency, and flexibility. Open-source tools can be customize to fit their specific needs, reduce vendor locks and contribute to a growing community focused on improving industry standards. 

In addition to industry professionals, academic institutions and researchers can benefit from imxInsights by using railway data for in-depth analysis, simulations, and studies aimed at advancing transportation research.

Overall, imxInsights is designed to support anyone invested in the railway ecosystem, enabling better decision-making, fostering collaboration, and advancing the future of rail transport.

## Real-World Use Cases
- **Review Process Support**: Achieving a safe rail design requires implementing traceable changes within the dataset. A critical aspect of this process is a structured change review, involving multiple stakeholders. ImxInsights generates standardized difference reports facilitating this review process. 

   *Future updates will further enhance workflow support within ImxInsights to streamline collaboration and oversight.*
